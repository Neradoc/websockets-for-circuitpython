A library to connect to a websockets server


Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://circuitpython.org/libraries>`_
or individual libraries can be installed using
`circup <https://github.com/adafruit/circup>`_.

Installing to a Connected CircuitPython Device with Circup
==========================================================

Make sure that you have ``circup`` installed in your Python environment.
Install it with the following command if necessary:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install circup

With ``circup`` installed and your CircuitPython device connected use the
following command to install:

.. code-block:: shell

    circup install websockets

Or the following command to update an existing version:

.. code-block:: shell

    circup update

Usage Example
=============

.. todo:: Add a quick, simple example. It and other examples should live in the
examples folder and be included in docs/examples.rst.
